# CP1404/5632 Assignment: Songs To Learn by YE YINT THET KHINE

This is the second version of the our assignments. Therefore, there are same logic behind the program. However, in the assessment two,
there are something that need to use very well which is kivy. Combining the kivy and the python programming is actually very worked.
It worked more than expected.

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
Although this assignment is a modified version of assignment 1, this took more than a week to complete it.
Note: You may like to use the WakaTime plugin, which tracks exactly how long you spend in code. See http://wakatime.com (but note that the free version only has a 7-day history)

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
Previous assignment was like a practice for me and this assigment helps me to understand about kivy GUI.

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
I had very little time to focus on the assignment as the due date for all the assigment were in the same week.

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
Searching the songs from the list works well and I am very satisfied with it.

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
I should practice more about the topic we will be working on.

## 6. Describe what resources you used and how you used them.
I used the previous assigment to modify it and refer to internet on how kivy works as I did not understand very well about kivy.

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
My program did not work and many errors popped up while I was struggling with multiple assigments which made me feel very stressful. Altough I was busy with other assigments, I tried to finish them one by one instead of focusing on everyone at the same time.
